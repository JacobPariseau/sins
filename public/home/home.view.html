	<h2>What is Sins?</h2>
	<p>A long long time ago, a proud deity named Simon kept the world safe from
		evil. Since all bad deeds were heavily punished, everyone decided to be
		polite and get along. But with no one misbehaving, no one needed Simon, so
		he decided to make more and more choices off-limits.</p>

		<h2>How to Start?</h2>
		<p>Sit everyone in a circle and enter their names in clock-wise. When everyone
			is in, click THAT'S EVERYONE and the game will begin with the draw of a card.</p>
		<h2>Category Cards</h2>
		<p>CATEGORY cards are divided into two colours. The top half is to be read aloud
			and performed until the condition on the bottom half (which you don't read aloud)
			is met. Then, the next player starts their turn.</p>
		<h2>Trap Cards</h2>
		<p>When your turn starts, you might draw a TRAP card, which will automatically
			go into your hand once clicked. You can play a TRAP card at any time, as long
			as the condition is met.</p>
		<h2>Smiting</h2>
		<p>If a card tells you to smite a player, select their name from the top bar,
			click the action button, and click SMITE. This will draw them a card which
			will either be an ACTION or a STATUS card. ACTIONs are to be performed immediately,
			while STATUS cards go into the player's hand and must be followed continuously.</p>
