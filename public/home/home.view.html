		<h2>What is Sins?</h2>
		<p>A long long time ago, a proud deity named Simon kept the world safe from
			evil. Since all bad deeds were heavily punished, everyone decided to be
			polite and get along. But with no one misbehaving, no one needed Simon, so
			the punishments got more and more frequent.</p>

			<h2>How to Start?</h2>
			<p>Sit everyone in a circle and enter their names in clock-wise. When everyone
				is in, click THAT'S EVERYONE and the game will begin with the draw of a card.</p>

			<h2>The Cards</h2>
			<p>There are three types of cards: EVENT, TRAP, and SMITE</p>
			<h2>Event Cards</h2>
			<p>At the start of your turn, the random card you draw will either be an
				EVENT or TRAP card. EVENT cards start little minigames. A common type is
				a Category card, where the players take turns listing items that fit the
				category. If a player takes too long, says something wrong, or something
				that another player has mentioned already, they must draw a SMITE card.

			<h2>Trap Cards</h2>
			<p>You can play a TRAP card at any point in the game, as long as its
			condition is met. Unless the card says otherwise, a TRAP card will only work
			on 1 player. If a TRAP card says to SMITE a player when they stand up, and 2
			players stand at the same time, you must choose which one to SMITE. Active
			trap cards can be found in their respective players' hand <strong>only on
			the player's turn.</strong> The hand can be accessed through the action button
			in the bottom right or by swiping up.</p>

			<h2>Smite Cards</h2>
			<p>If a card tells you to smite a player, switch to the SMITE deck by clicking
				the action button in the bottom right, then click the deck. SMITING players
				does not affect normal turn order and can be done at any time.
				<br />
			There are two types of SMITE cards: ACTION, and STATUS. ACTION cards are to
			be performed immediately and discarded, while STATUS cards remain active until
			another card says otherwise. Active STATUS cards can be found the respective
			players' hand, which can be accessed from the action button or by swiping up</p>
